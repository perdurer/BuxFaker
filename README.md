## ✨ Features

* **Real-Time Modification**: Change your Robux amount instantly via the sleek popup interface.
* **Premium UI/UX**: Modern dark-mode design with reactive animations (Rotating logos and explosion effects).
* **Smart Transaction Menu**: Seamlessly replaces the native Roblox Robux menu with a custom version, including a functional-looking "My Transactions" button.
* **Anti-Reveal Protection**: Any attempt to access the real transaction history page automatically redirects to a **404 Error**, maintaining the illusion of your fake balance.
* **Stealth Mode**: A quick toggle in the settings allows you to enable or disable the modifier instantly.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Setting the Balance
Click the extension icon in your toolbar. Enter your desired amount in the text field. The balance is automatically formatted (e.g., `1.2M+` or `500K+`) on the Roblox interface for total realism.

### 2. Protected Navigation
The extension dynamically injects scripts into Roblox pages:
* The navigation bar balance is replaced site-wide.
* The Robux dropdown menu is modified to look authentic.
* **Safety Intercept**: If a user clicks on "Transactions," the extension intercepts the request and force-loads a 404 page, simulating a Roblox system glitch rather than revealing your actual balance.

### 3. Visual Polish
Hover over the logo in the popup to trigger a **smooth rotation animation** followed by a **re-assembly effect**, giving the extension a high-end, polished feel.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This extension is created for **entertainment purposes only**.
* The generated Robux are **purely visual** (client-side only).
* They cannot be spent or used for actual purchases.
* Refreshing the page while the extension is disabled will show your real balance.
